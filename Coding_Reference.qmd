Derivatives in R using 'D()' ---- trying to find the derivative of 5x\^2, but you can't write just that into R ----

create an expression ----

```{r}
my_expression <- expression(5*x^2)
```

find the derivative of our expression now, with respect to x ---- create a new variable for this ----

```{r}
my_derivative <- D(expr=my_expression, name="x")
```

now we can look at our derivative: ----

```{r}
my_derivative
```

to learn more, you can always look at the documentation for a function by typing into the console ?D ---- you can do this with any function ----

now, let's evaulate our derivative at a value of x=2.8 ----

```{r}
x <- 2.8
eval(my_derivative)
```
